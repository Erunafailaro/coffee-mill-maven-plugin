Assets optimization
===================

The plugins can optimize your PNG and JPEG files to reduce their sizes.

Prerequisites
-------------

The plugin relies on `optipng` and `jpegtran`. However, those programs must be installed and available in your system
path.

To install those tools refer to:

* [optiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)
* [JpegTran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/)

If you are using a Homebrew for Mac, the installation is pretty simple:

    brew install optipng
    brew install libjpeg

If the tools are missing, the optimization is skipped.

Optimizing PNG files
---------------------

The PNG optimization is automatically enabled in _regular_ Maven builds (during the _compile_ phase) and in _watch_ mode. PNG files from _target/www_ are optimized in-place.

You can configure the optimization level between 0 and 7. 0 does not optimize the file, 7 is highly optimize but slows down the process. The default level is 2.

More info about the configuration is available on the [Optimize PNG Mojo Page](./optimize-png-mojo.html).

Optimizing JPEG files
----------------------

The JPEG optimization is automatically enabled in _regular_ Maven builds (during the _compile_ phase)and in _watch_ mode. `jpg` and `jpeg` files files from _target/www_ are optimized in-place. However, the process creates a temporary file and then replace the file.

More info about the configuration is available on the [Optimize JPEG Mojo Page](./optimize-jpeg-mojo.html).

Optimizing HTML files
---------------------

The plugin is able to compress HTML files. However this feature is disabled by default, and must be enabled in your _pom.xml_ file. You can find more info on the [compress HTML pages](./compress-html-mojo.html).
